summary: Have been created a model for estimating the performance of communication protocols for channels with noises and simulated on Matlab Communication Toolbox. The results of simulations and implement models on the EMC 2 data-center are compared. It is shown that their deviation does not exceed the boundaries of 11%, which confirms the consistency of the research.
